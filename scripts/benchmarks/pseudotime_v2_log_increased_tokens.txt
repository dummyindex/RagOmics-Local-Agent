                                   - use 'pip install scikit-learn' rather than 
                             'pip install sklearn'                              
                                   - replace 'sklearn' by 'scikit-learn' in your
                             pip requirements files                             
                                     (requirements.txt, setup.py, setup.cfg,    
                             Pipfile, etc ...)                                  
                                   - if the 'sklearn' package is used by one of 
                             your dependencies,                                 
                                     it would be great if you take some time to 
                             track which package uses                           
                                     'sklearn' instead of 'scikit-learn' and
