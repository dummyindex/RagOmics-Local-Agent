# Pseudotime Benchmark Test Results

## Summary

Successfully fixed the Docker container build issues with meson, allowing the benchmark to run. The test made significant progress but encountered API usage errors.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Docker Build Issues ✓
- **Problem**: meson version 0.61.2 from apt was too old for scikit-misc (requires >= 0.63.3)
- **Solution**: Updated Dockerfile to install meson 1.8.3 via pip
- **Result**: Docker image now builds successfully with all required build tools

### 2. Test Execution Progress
The benchmark successfully:
- ✓ Created preprocessing nodes
- ✓ Executed DPT + PAGA analysis (after fixing root cell selection)
- ✗ Failed on Palantir due to incorrect API usage

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Package Import Errors
The LLM-generated code had incorrect imports:
```python
# Incorrect (generated by LLM)
from palantir import palantir
from palantir import run as palantir_run

# Correct usage should be:
import palantir
# Then use palantir's API correctly
```

### 2. Non-unique Cell Names Warning
```
UserWarning: Observation names are not unique. To make them unique, call `.obs_names_make_unique`.
```

### 3. Missing Root Cell for DPT
The LLM successfully fixed this by adding:
- Diffusion map computation before DPT
- Root cell selection logic

## Test Statistics

- **Total execution time**: ~4 minutes
- **Nodes created**: 3
- **Successful nodes**: 2 (preprocessing, DPT+PAGA)
- **Failed nodes**: 1 (Palantir, with 3 fix attempts)

## Recommendations

### 1. Improve Function Creator Prompts
Add more explicit examples of correct package imports and API usage:
- Show exact import patterns for each pseudotime package
- Include working code snippets in prompts

### 2. Add Package Documentation Context
Provide the LLM with:
- Basic API documentation for each pseudotime method
- Common usage patterns
- Expected input/output formats

### 3. Pre-validate Generated Code
Add a validation step that checks:
- Import statements are syntactically correct
- Required functions exist in imported modules
- Basic API usage patterns match known signatures

### 4. Continue Iterative Refinement
The system is working as designed:
- It attempts to fix errors automatically
- It provides context from error messages
- It needs more specific guidance for complex package APIs

## Next Steps

1. Add more detailed package usage examples to prompts
2. Include minimal working examples for each pseudotime method
3. Consider pre-installing more packages in Docker image to reduce installation time
4. Add validation for common import/API usage errors

## Conclusion

The core infrastructure (Docker, execution, error handling) is working well. The main challenge is providing sufficient context for the LLM to generate correct API usage for specialized bioinformatics packages. This is expected given the complexity and variability of these packages' APIs.
